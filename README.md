A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game either against another player or an AI. The AI uses a Minimax Algorithm for optimal play, ensuring it never loses when playing at the "hard" difficulty level.

Features
Player vs. Player Mode: Play with a friend on the same device.
Player vs. AI Mode: Play against an AI that can be set to different difficulty levels:
Easy: Random AI moves.
Medium: AI tries to block the opponent's winning move or picks randomly.
Hard: AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of Player X, Player O, and Draw scores across multiple rounds.
Responsive Design: The game is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
